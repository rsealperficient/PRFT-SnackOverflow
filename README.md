<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This repo contains backend and frontend directory. CMS configuration is in backend directory and Next.js/React on the frontend.

Clone the repository and install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/rsealperficient/PRFT-SnackOverflow.git
cd PRFT-SnackOverflow
```

Start the servers separately:

**Start the backend server**

```sh
cd backend
npm install
npm run build
npm run develop
```

Strapi server is running at http://localhost:1337

Once the build is complete it will prompt you to register an account. You would need to create an account to be able to log in to Strapi backend.
